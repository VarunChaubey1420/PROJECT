# Simple Weather App (Beginner)

A tiny front-end app that displays sample weather data for a few cities.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click file).
2. Enter a city like "Delhi", "Mumbai" or "Chennai" and click Get Weather.

## To enable real API (optional)
1. Get a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/.
2. In `app.js`, uncomment the fetch call and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your key.
3. Serve the folder via a simple static server (optional) or open index.html directly.
